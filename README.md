# CodenationTextBasedGame
This was created in one week as part of my training with Codenation, using AGILE methodology as part of a team.

## Intentions of this project
This project was an exercise in working as part of a team in a professional environment, with a member of the team taking the role as Project Manager, 
and delegating tasks to the other team members
